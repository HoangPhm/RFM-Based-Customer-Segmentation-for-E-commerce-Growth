# RFM-Based-Customer-Segmentation-for-E-commerce-Growth
This project uses the 'Online Retail' dataset to perform RFM-based Customer Segmentation. We aim to identify distinct customer groups (Loyal, At-Risk, New) based on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value. The goal is to inform personalized marketing strategies to maximize customer lifetime value (CLV) and optimize retention efforts.
